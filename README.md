Create a robust backend API for payment validation using Java Spring Boot. Design a controller with an endpoint ("/validate-payment") to receive payment data. Implement a service layer for business logic, including checks for card validity and fund availability. Ensure secure communication using HTTPS, integrate exception handling, and set up logging for error tracking. Test thoroughly, document API endpoints with tools like Swagger, and deploy the Spring Boot application, emphasizing ongoing monitoring and maintenance for optimal performance and security.
